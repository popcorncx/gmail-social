gmail-social
============

Scripts to query Facebook/Twitter for new posts and then inject those
posts via IMAP into a Gmail account as individual messages. Can then
deal with these at the same time as my other email messages.

Cobbled together a number of years ago, mostly working unmodified since
then.
